# InsightForge: The Omniscient Research Agent

## 🚀 Mission
To replace hours of tab-switching and reading with 15 seconds of AI-powered synthesis. InsightForge isn't just a summarizer; it's an intelligent research partner that finds the truth between the lines.

## 🌟 Core Features

### 1. **Universal Input Analysis**
*   **Web Resources**: Paste any URL (Blog posts, YouTube videos, News articles, Technical documentation).
*   **Document Ingestion**: Drag & Drop PDF research papers, contracts, or raw text files.
*   **The "Magic"**: Automatically detects content type and adjusts analysis strategy.

### 2. **"Nuclear" Auto-Research Mode**
*   **The Pain Point**: Reading one article gives you one biased opinion.
*   **The Solution**: Toggle "Nuclear Mode" to force the agent to:
    *   Read the target link.
    *   Search for 3-5 *additional* distinct sources on the web.
    *   Cross-reference claims.
    *   Generate a Master Report showing **Consensus** (what everyone agrees on) and **Controversy** (where they disagree).

### 3. **Adaptive Complexity Engines**
*   **Standard Mode**: Balanced, professional summary.
*   **ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5)**: Breaks down complex topics into simple analogies. Perfect for understanding quantum physics or crypto protocols in seconds.
*   **Pro (PhD Expert)**: Switches to high-level technical jargon, strategic implications, and data-heavy analysis.

### 4. **Actionable Intelligence**
*   **Twitter Thread Generator**: One click transforms a dense report into a viral-ready thread with hooks, emojis, and "1/x" formatting.
*   **"Devil's Advocate" Engine**: The "Find Opposing Views" button specifically hunts for counter-arguments, risks, and negative reviews to prevent confirmation bias.

### 5. **Trust & Verification (Citations)**
*   **Rich Source Cards**: Sources aren't just text links; they are visual cards with Favicons and domain context.
*   **Primary vs. Secondary**: Clearly distinguishes between the user's provided link (Primary Target) and AI-discovered supporting evidence.
*   **Inline Citations**: Every claim is backed by a number [1][2] linking directly to the source.

## 🛠 Technical Architecture

### **AI Core**
*   **Engine**: Google Gemini 2.5 Flash.
*   **Grounding**: Native Google Search Grounding for real-time, up-to-date verification.
*   **Context Window**: Large context handling for processing full PDF manuscripts.

### **Frontend Engineering**
*   **Framework**: React 19.
*   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom animations (glassmorphism, pulse effects, subtle gradients).
*   **Icons**: Lucide React for a clean, consistent iconography.
*   **State Management**: React Hooks for managing complex chat states, thinking modes, and drag-and-drop logic.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy
*   **"Command Center" Aesthetic**: The UI mimics a professional analyst's dashboard rather than a toy chatbot.
*   **Feedback Loops**: "Thinking" states are visualized with pulsing indicators and specific status messages (e.g., "Cross-referencing sources...").
*   **Minimalism**: Hidden complexity. The interface is clean until you need the advanced tools.

## 🎯 Use Cases
1.  **Due Diligence**: Investors checking a startup's claims against competitor news.
2.  **Content Creation**: YouTubers researching a topic to find the "spiciest" takes for a script.
3.  **Academic Review**: Students uploading a paper to get a breakdown of methodology and flaws.
4.  **Tech Learning**: Developers reading documentation to understand a new framework vs. its alternatives.
